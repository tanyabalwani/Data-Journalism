Employment Situation of Graduates of Full-time UGC-funded Programmes by University, Level of Study, Employment Situation and Occupation

## Purpose

Our report takes a deep dive into the current job situation of graduates from UGC funded institutions in Hong Kong. The aim of this study is to derive key insights on the employment situation and provide an overview on the current measures universities and the government have taken in light of the dwelling issues in the city, especially in regards to the political turmoil and more recently, COVID-19. By analyzing and visualizing graduate and employment trends in the past decade compared to now, as well as reviewing the perspective of fresh graduates affected by both issues, we were able to structure a in-depth exploration of the present job climate in the city. The responses from potential graduates, universites, and employers themselves from a mixture of data research, personal interviews and statistical coverage from local media allowed us to target the potential challenges that fresh graduates face entering the Hong Kong workforce. With university students today facing the toughest job market in the past decade, it is important to take a look at these potential challenges as students and soon-to-be UGC graduates ourselves. 

## Research questions

  1. Are there observable differences in the employment situation across different occupations over the years?

  2. Are there observable differences in the employment situation across different levels of study?

The first research question was formulated to research on the consequential effect of protest and covid19 on the employment scenario for Hong Kong, but due to the lack of appropriate data on the topic, we chose to focus on the overall trend throughout the years and across different levels of study. 

The second question was formulated with an aim to understand the necessity for a postgraduate degree to successfully qualify for a job in a competitive job seeking environment.
